## Introduction

The IoT-Based Intruder Detection System is a smart home security solution that leverages the power of Internet of Things (IoT) technology to protect your home from potential intruders. The system uses a combination of the Bolt Wi-Fi module, Light-Dependent Resistor (LDR) sensor, Light-Emitting Diode and a buzzer to detect sudden changes in light intensity and trigger an alert mechanism in real-time.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of light intensity changes
- SMS alerts to notify the homeowner of potential intrusions
- Buzzer activation to deter intruders and alert nearby individuals
- Seamless integration with the Bolt IoT Platform for secure communication

## Hardware Setup

- Bolt Wi-Fi module
- Light-Emitting Diode (LED)
- Light-Dependent Resistor (LDR) sensor
- Buzzer
